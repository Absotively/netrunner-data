Netrunner cards EDN data
===

This repository is the primary data source for Jinteki.net. Based on [Alsciende's
netrunner-card-json](https://github.com/Alsciende/netrunner-cards-json) data, it holds
all Fantasy Flight (and any as-of-yet-unreleased NISEI) Netrunner card data in Clojure's
native [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) format, which allows for both ease of
use and ease of development.

For our purposes, it makes some changes to the original data. I don't plan on this being
anything more than an internal repo, but all are welcome to use and contribute as
needed.
